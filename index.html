            Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the
            acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits,
            and personal development.[1] Education originated as transmission of
            cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today,
            educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as
            liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented
            information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy and
            complex vocational skills.

          UNESCO defines three main learning settings.[2] Formal education takes
          place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by
          curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a
          teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a
          certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as
          kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal learning
          occurs as addition or alternative to formal education. [3] It may be
          structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more
          flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based,
          workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal
          settings occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has
          a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In
          practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly
          informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three
          settings.[4] For instance, homeschooling can be classified as
          nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.

          Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training,
          storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of
          teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of
          different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.

          After the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver
          of literate scholarship in Western Europe.[13] The church established
          cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced
          education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into
          medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern
          universities.[8] During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral
          operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The
          medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated
          across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and
          produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers,
          including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert
          Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a
          systematic method of scientific experimentation,[14] and Saint Albert
          the Great, a pioneer of biological field research.[15] Founded in
          1088, the University of Bologne is considered the first, and the
          oldest continually operating university.[16]
